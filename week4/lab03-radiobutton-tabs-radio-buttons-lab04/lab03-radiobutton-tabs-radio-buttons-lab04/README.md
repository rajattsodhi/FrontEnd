# Using 3rd-party code

This version of the radio button tabbed navigation includes a link to the the [W3.CSS framework](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/).

Read up on the classes at the link above, and experiment. For instance:

- look at [W3.CSS fluid grids](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_grid.asp) and make a 3-column grid for the images.
- read up on the [W3.CSS colour themes](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_color_themes.asp) and try adding the classes to elements in your html to create a harmonious appearance.
