	<h2>CSS-only responsive menu</h2>

	<p>It's not optimised for touch and needs <a href="http://testing.com">testing</a>. It's also as ugly as ****. But this is a solid start so shut up.</p>

	<p>Because you can't animate the CSS <code>display</code> property, <code>height</code>, <code>opacity</code> and <code>visibility</code> do the job perfectly well.</p>

	<p>It's good to simplify markup as much as possible. But using <code>inline-block</code> on <code>a</code> tags for menu items (inside a <code>nav</code>) means—if they're on separate lines in your code—there's a space between them (an <em>inline</em> space) unless you actually put them all <em>inline in the HTML code</em> without a space or line break between them.</p>

	<h2 id="greyscale">Greyscale style</h2>

	<p>The basic grey styles basically highlight the elements without detracting from the functionality.</p>
