## Workshops
Location: see your personal timetable
One 2-hour workshop per week (see timetable above).

Practical workshops involve semi-taught sessions and hands-on coding, and are a focussed place to work on your assessments and develop skills through practical work. Attending all workshops will ensure that you keep up with the material and work towards your individual project assignment (see below for assignment details). Students who attend regularly tend to produce higher-quality work and gain better marks.

**Your attendance at workshops counts as an ongoing viva (10% of the final module mark). Weekly notes will be kept for each student to help track and personalise the learning experience.**

Work submitted without sufficient attendance may be rejected, and code is **always** examined for plagiarism.

## Lectures
**Location:** HB1.05  
**Time:** Thursdays 15:00-17:00

Nine 2-hour lectures, every *two* weeks (see timetable above).

Lectures match and complement the practical workshops, and cover essential technical issues as well as the wider perspectives on front-end web technologies. You will learn to make intelligent choices and predict future industry trends in this rapidly-changing and complex field.

## Module details

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this module, through attendance and participation in workshops, and after successful completion of lab tasks and assignments, students will be able to:

1. Contextualise and critique the aims and culture driving current web technologies, how these have evolved and what part they play in modern web development.
2. Develop a critical understanding of basic design principles, Information Architecture (IA), usability principles and semantic markup, and how these determine navigability, usability and website/webapp structure.
3. Demonstrate evidence of a detailed understanding of the current front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and make intelligent choices regarding their use and context.
4. Create a fully standards-compliant, responsive and accessible website or web-technology-based application using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

In addition, best practice in general software development (e.g. version control, consistent code indentation, etc.) will be encouraged throughout the module.

### Blackboard resources

Blackboard is a crucial part of this module, so take some time to read through the material there—it contains:
  - the module timetable
  - links useful to this module
  - lecture outlines and related material
  - tutorial and example code
  - key texts and research sources

### Handing in work and submitting to Turnitin

**Feedback:** will be given on work in progress during workshop sessions and in written form for assignments. The final assignment will be assessed within four weeks of the deadline.

**Reminder**: all marks are provisional, subject to moderation, and will be ratified by the June Progress and Awards Board.

**Turnitin** the DMU Library has an excellent reference: [Frequently Asked Questions: Using TurnitinUK in Blackboard to submit your work](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14).

### Assessment 0: ongoing development
10% of overall marks

Your contribution and development from active participation in workshops and lectures will be assessed throughout the duration of the module. You simply need to engage with the module and show good progress in your understanding, skills and main project.

### Assessment 1: critical essay
30% of overall marks  
Deadline: 12pm Friday 18th November (week 7)

#### Deliverable:
A 2000-3000 word piece of illustrated and referenced **written work**. To be submitted via Turnitin.

Choose 3-4 websites and evaluate their quality and method of construction. These can be a comparison of one kind or subject (e.g. portfolios, sports, gaming, media, commerce…), or cover how a technology (e.g. Javascript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3 animations…) is used over differing sites.

Use structured headings (level 1, level 2…) throughout and include screen shots, diagrams, tables, lists etc. only where these clarify the points you are making.

For correct referencing, see the [DMU Library guide on Harvard Referencing](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Guides/index.php?page=495).

For Turnitin, please use RTF, Word documents or PDFs ([see “What type of files can be submitted in Turnitin?“](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14#f6)). To gain experience in other more future-friendly formats you could also generate a PDF of your essay from Markdown, Multimarkdown or LaTeX (if you do this, add a note to explain your choice). In all cases, make sure your external links and links to references all resolve correctly.

#### What your essay should cover
- is the website style effective and well-balanced (css, visual design elements…)?
- how is the website content (video, sound, gallery, forum, blog, chat, etc) delivered?
- does the site use any external APIs?
- does it use any frameworks, libraries etc.?
- does it suit the target audience?
- is the navigation effective?
- are there any usability issues or errors?
- does it use any specifically accessible code?
- is the code readable and well-structured?
- is it a single-page-app (SPA) or a series of pages?
- how are any user interaction animations or transitions generated?

#### Assessment 1 Marking criteria
- Demonstrate clear understanding of the two markup (HTML5, CSS3) and one programming (Javascript) languages that comprise current front-end web technologies.
- Survey with references the historical context, current communities and ongoing development associated with these three languages.
- Demonstrate knowledge of the developments within front-end web code currently in progress, and show their degree of browser support.
- Some understanding of the issues involved in using frameworks, libraries, boilerplate code, framework starter kits and seed code, and the distinctions between them.
- Inclusion of illustrations (screen shots, diagrams, etc.)
- Clear use of semantically structured headings, tables, lists etc.

### Assessment 2: practical project and critical evaluation
60% of overall marks  
Deadline: 12pm Friday 10th March (week 23)

#### Deliverable:
1. the final **project code**
1. the **plans and sketches** for your final project
2. text annotations, notes, references, minimal code comments, etc. explaining your project, and/or a brief essay (400-600 words + screenshots) outlining your decisions during the development process

#### Can include:
- initial design ideas, sketches or screenshots (e.g. a greyscale/plain wireframe prototype)
- a working prototype (you can use something like Invision for this or code basic HTML/CSS/JS)
- a navigation plan, IA diagram or site diagram

#### Should demonstrate:
- the correct semantic use of HTML5 elements
- basic CSS outline for element layout
- working responsive design code
- reference to design theory
- understanding of IA and interaction design

## University policy

### Anonymous marking
Because of the practical nature of this module, there will be no anonymous marking, as the origin of each students’ work is obvious to the tutors from workshop sessions.

### Late work
This will be penalised according to university rules and regulations. These rules also apply to work submitted after a *14-day extension deadline* authorised by the Module Tutor/Leader.

Coursework received after 2.00pm on the deadline date
: *without an agreed extension* will be stamped ‘late’ and marked down accordingly. The centre (FOTAC) will close promptly at the published times, so work cannot be accepted until 9.00am on the following working day.

Coursework submitted within 7 days from the deadline
: *without prior permission from the Module Tutor/Leader* will be subject to a cap of **40%**

Coursework submitted later than 7 days after the deadline
: *with no prior notice* will receive a mark of **0%**.

### Extensions
These may be granted for significant reasons (e.g. health issues, serious family problems, etc.) They **cannot** be granted for bad the management, pressure from other module deadlines, minor illness, etc.

### Deferrals, failure and reassessment
In very exceptional circumstances, a deferral may be granted.

If you are judged to have failed the course, contact your workshop tutor as soon as possible for advice on what practical work to undertake in order to resubmit for reassessment, and when studio facilities will be available, if required.

### Plagiarism (using work from other sources)
Before you write anything, read the DMU library page [“What is plagiarism”](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14#f1). As for copying code, developers often examine source code from other sites and adapt features they like into their own work. However, pre–designed templates that entire designs, copying tutorials mindlessly, or taking code wholly or substantially from other sources is not acceptable for assessments, as you will learn very little. So always explain *if and how* you have adapted any third-party code or online tutorials and examples to demonstrate that you understand what you’re doing.

The practical work submitted for this course must be your own, so be aware that tutors know how to check source code in detail. The essay will be submitted via Turnitin, which highlights copied text.

**For further information**, please refer to the [student regulations on the DMU website](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/student-regulations.aspx).
